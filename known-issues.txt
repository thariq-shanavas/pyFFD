The FD solver introduces a background E-field because of the instability problem.
This likely makes contrast lower as we go deeper into tissue.

Details:
In the following line in PropagationAlgorithm.py, frequencies above n/lambda are suppressed, where n is the 1% low value.
alpha = 2*np.pi*np.sqrt(np.maximum(fxfx**2+fyfy**2-np.percentile(index,1)**2/wavelength**2,0))

However, this still does not suppress the problem completely.

The total power of the beam keeps increasing with depth. ???
For the time being, the workaround is to normalize the power of the donut before calculating STED PSF

The adaptive resolution introduces artefacts when depth is a multiple of the z-step size where the resolution is re-calculated.

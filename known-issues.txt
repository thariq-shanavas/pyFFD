The FD solver introduces a background E-field because of the instability problem.
This likely makes contrast lower as we go deeper into tissue.

Details:
In the following line in PropagationAlgorithm.py, frequencies above n/lambda are suppressed, where n is the 1% low value.
alpha = 2*np.pi*np.sqrt(np.maximum(fxfx**2+fyfy**2-np.percentile(index,1)**2/wavelength**2,0))

However, this still does not suppress the problem completely.
